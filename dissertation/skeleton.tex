\title{Evaluating data reduction techniques for supervised training}

\author{Yuwen Heng}

\abstract{
Training deep neural networks can be resources-consuming. The budget required is increasing with the size of the dataset. During the past few decades, many research is dedicated to developing training procedures to accelerate the convergence speed of deep learning. However, we still need the whole dataset to train the network and paying for a large dataset may not pay back well if we can use a smaller subset to achieve an acceptable performance. To solve this issue, we first adapted and evaluated three methods, Patterns by Ordered Projections (POP), Enhanced Global Density-based Instance Selection (EGDIS), and Curriculum Learning (CL), to reduce the size of two image datasets, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, for the classification task. Based on the analysis, we present our two contributions: the Weighted Curriculum Learning (WCL) and a trade-off framework. The WCL outperforms POP and EGDIS in terms of both classification accuracy and time complexity. It achieves comparable performance compared with CL while keeping a portion of hard examples. The trade-off framework selects a subset of samples according to the acceptable relative accuracy and the dataset. In addition, the framework is also extended to predict the number of samples needed to achieve a particular accuracy with a given subset.

\section*{Acknowledgements}
First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Dr Yang Cao, for offering me the opportunity to work with him on such an attracting and challenging project. His encouragement and valuable guidance helped me tackle the obstacles in my research path. 

Furthermore, special thanks go to Professor Bob Fisher, Dr Pavlos Andreadis at the University of Edinburgh and Dr Jiacheng Ni at IBM for sharing me their knowledge about computer vision and deep learning. The programming skills and coursework experience that I learnt from them helped me to organise the experiments well.

Finally, I would like to send my love to my fiancee Danni Li for her accompany during the past three years . I wouldn't have the chance to study full-time without her full support.

\chapter{Your next chapter}

A dissertation usually contains several chapters.

\chapter{Conclusions}

\section{Final Reminder}

The body of your dissertation, before the references and any appendices,
\emph{must} finish by page~40. The introduction, after preliminary material,
should have started on page~1.

You may not change the dissertation format (e.g., reduce the font
size, change the margins, or reduce the line spacing from the default
1.5 spacing). Over length or incorrectly-formatted dissertations will
not be accepted and you would have to modify your dissertation and
resubmit.  You cannot assume we will check your submission before the
final deadline and if it requires resubmission after the deadline to
conform to the page and style requirements you will be subject to the
usual late penalties based on your final submission time.

%% You can include appendices like this:
% \appendix

% \chapter{First appendix}

% Markers do not have to consider appendices. Make sure that your contributions
% are made clear in the main body of the dissertation (within the page limit).
