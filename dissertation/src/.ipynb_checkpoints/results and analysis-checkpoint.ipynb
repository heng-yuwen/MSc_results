Many papers have proved this hypothesis with critical experiments. However, for deep learning, the performance is still unknown. If we consider the network as extracting features first and classify the features with a logistic regression algorithm, then the problem is whether the network can extract high-quality features or not with POP selected samples. Please note that the POP is not expected to get the same extracted features because of the randomness of deep learning.\n",

    "EGDIS is designed to select both boundary samples and the densest samples. However, samples at the boundary are harder to classify compared with inner samples. Therefore, the test accuracy may be slightly lower than other algorithms if we train the network with the same amount of samples. The benefit is that these boundary samples are the key to achieve higher accuracy and lower loss. Researchers can focus on designing new networks or training methods to classify them right. To prove the hypothsis, I plotted the density of classification scores of the boundary samples below. The left side is CIFAR10 and the right side is CIFAR100. I didn't use the generated datasets to show this because these datasets are too simple and most of the scores are above 0.9%. Also, for blobs, there is only 1 boundary sample selected. For moons, there are 3 boundary samples selected. For circles, there are 35 boundary samples selected. "

The reason why there are so many low-score samples is that the extracted features from NasNetLarge can only achieve a test accuracy of 71.60% (for CIFAR10, this value is 95.54,  which is close to the best accuracy that we can achieve). If we fine-tune the network with CIFAR100 in advance, the scores should be much higher and the boundary points should be much less.
